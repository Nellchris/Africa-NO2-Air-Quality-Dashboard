# 🌍 NO₂ Air Quality Dashboard (2018–2024)

This project presents an interactive dashboard that visualizes **Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂)** levels across Africa using **Sentinel-5P** satellite data. It provides insights into air quality trends over selected years and highlights regions with increasing or decreasing NO₂ concentrations.

Built using **Streamlit**, **Folium**, **Plotly**, and **GeoPandas**, the dashboard offers change detection visuals, and interactive charts for exploration.
